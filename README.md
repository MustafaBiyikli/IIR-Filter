# IIR-Filter
IIR Filter written in Python 3

* DirectFormII IIR filter/chain of 2nd order filters, see the Report.pdf file for an in-depth explanation.

* See realtime_iir_main.py for an example usage. This uses the Qt library for production the real-time plots. Data acquisiton is performed by an Arduino UNO board. pyfirmata2 library used for setting a constant sampling rate of 100Hz and allowing the Arduino to be programmed in Python.

* Arduino best used for mechanical measurements due to limited sampling rate of 100Hz, however, the IIR filter can be used with other data acquisiton boards.
